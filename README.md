🧮 Data Cleaning Practice Questions (10 Complete Challenges)
Question 1
Your dataset contains order_date in multiple formats: 'DD/MM/YYYY', 'DD-MM-YY', 'YYYY-MM-DD', and some invalid entries like '32/13/2020'. Clean and standardize all dates to 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, handling invalid dates appropriately.
Question 2
The original_price_inr column contains mixed data types: numeric values, text with '₹' symbols, comma separators ('₹1,25,000'), and some entries like 'Price on Request'. Clean this column to contain only numeric values in Indian Rupees.
Question 3
Customer ratings appear in various formats: '5.0', '4 stars', '3/5', '2.5/5.0', and some missing values. Standardize all ratings to numeric scale 1.0-5.0, handling inconsistent formats and missing values strategically.
Question 4
The customer_city column has inconsistent naming: 'Bangalore/Bengaluru', 'Mumbai/Bombay', 'Delhi/New Delhi', along with spelling errors and case variations. Standardize all city names and handle geographical variations.
Question 5
Boolean columns (is_prime_member, is_prime_eligible, is_festival_sale) contain mixed values: True/False, Yes/No, 1/0, Y/N, and some missing entries. Convert all boolean columns to consistent True/False format.
Question 6
Product categories have variations: 'Electronics/Electronic/ELECTRONICS/Electronics & Accessories'. Standardize category names across the dataset and ensure consistent naming conventions.
Question 7
The delivery_days column contains negative values, text entries like 'Same Day', '1-2 days', and some unrealistic values like 50 days. Clean this column to contain only valid numeric delivery days.
Question 8
Identify and handle duplicate transactions where the same customer, product, date, and amount appear multiple times. Some duplicates are genuine (bulk orders) while others are data errors. Develop a strategy to distinguish and handle both cases.
Question 9
The dataset contains outlier prices where some products show prices 100x higher than expected due to data entry errors (decimal point issues). Identify and correct these outliers using statistical methods and domain knowledge.
Question 10
Payment methods contain inconsistent naming: 'UPI/PhonePe/GooglePay', 'Credit Card/CREDIT_CARD/CC', 'Cash on Delivery/COD/C.O.D'. Standardize payment method categories and create a clean categorical hierarchy.
